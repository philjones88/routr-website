Routr API version is currently `v1beta1`. We continue to improve the API, resource definition, and other artifacts until we reach a final version. We can then establish a policy to ensure backward compatibility. Until then keep an eye on this document.

The endpoint for the API is:

`/api/{apiversion}`

## Authentication

A JWT token is used to authenticate the server. To obtain the token, use the `/api/{apiversion}/token` endpoint with basic authentication. Use the information from the [User](/configuration/user) resource.

> You must append the `token` to all requests as a query parameter.

**Sample call**

To obtain the token

```bash
curl -k -u "admin:changeit" https://localhost:4567/api/v1beta1/token

# Resulted in
{
    "status":200,
    "message":"Successful request",
    "data":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbiJ9.TZZ4kp5xIdYzs5RRt6_qVxJcOiLdk1IEHFMBSZ7SRENx6kyVhwfAlm-oeM4L2XFIr4evlTCxKEIKc0fZKwPcjw"
}
```

To use the token

```bash
curl -k -u "admin:changeit" https://localhost:4567/api/v1beta1/location?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.e...

# Resulted in
{  
   "status":200,
   "message":"Successful request",
   "data":[  
      {  
         "addressOfRecord":"sip:1001@sip.local",
         "contactInfo":"sip:45962087@192.168.1.127:61147;transport=tcp;nat=false;expires=600"
      }
   ]
}
```
