# Roadmap

The following is only a selection of some of the major features we plan to implement soon. To get a complete overview of planned features and current work, see the issue trackers for the various repositories, for example, the [Routr server](https://github.com/fonoster/routr/issues).

## Accounting, Authentication, and Authorization

Routr does not currently provide any mechanism for aid the accounting. Our current priority is to implement a module to support pushing accounting, authentication, and authorization events.

## IM and Presence

We understand that instant-messaging and presence are an essential piece of any VoIP network. We are currently looking into the SIMPLE and XCAP protocols to provide IM and Presence in Routr.

## Per-domain Certificate

Routr, currently its only possible to install a single certificate with multiple-domains. In the future, we want to ease the certificate installation/updating process by allowing a per-domain certificate.

## Support the Ecosystem

We want to release a stable version of the [web UI](https://github.com/fonoster/routr-ui) soon. The web UI is one of our primary strategy to facilitate the deployment of VoIP networks with Routr.
