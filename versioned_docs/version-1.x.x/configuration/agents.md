# Agents

Agents represent SIP endpoints such as softphones, IP phones, or paging speakers.
A Domain binds agents together. An Agent can belong to one or multiple Domains.

The Agents configuration can be provided using the file `config/agents.yml` located at the root of your Routr installation.

> If using Redis this configuration gets stored in the database.
