# Peers

Like Agents, Peers represent SIP endpoints such as Media Servers.

Unlike Agents, Peers aren't bound by a Domain.

The Peers configuration can be provided using the file `config/peers.yml` located at the root of your Routr installation.

> If using Redis this configuration gets stored in the database.
