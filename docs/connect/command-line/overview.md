# Overview

The command-line tool contains all commands you will need to manage your Routr Connect server.

To install Routr with npm, you will need to run the following command:

```javascript
npm install --location=global @routr/ctl
```

Most commands follow a CRUD pattern. For example, to manage your Agents you can use create, delete, describe, and get. Also, most commands follow the {substantive} {verb} pattern. For example, "rctl agents get" will return a list of agents.

Please see the following sections for more information on each command.
